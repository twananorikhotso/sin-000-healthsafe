# HealthSafe

## Overview

Hospital ward status and emergency staffing schedules.

Domain entities: wards, wings, specialist departments.

Every class in this repo lives in a single flat package, `co.wethinkcode.healthsafe`. HealthSafe is built
as a small set of independent services, following a growth path from simple data
cleanup through synchronous REST calls to asynchronous MQ decoupling and alerting:

1. clean a messy legacy CSV export (`wards-outdated.csv`) — handled by **IngestionServiceApp**
2. serve it up and act on it, via three REST services calling each other directly
   over HTTP
3. decouple the relevant services with an ActiveMQ topic (`staffing-events-topic`) instead of
   direct calls — shared broker setup lives in [`common/`](common)
4. raise the alarm on failure — handled by **EquipmentAlertServiceApp**

| Service | Folder | Port | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| IngestionServiceApp | [`ingestion-service/`](ingestion-service) | 7030 | Parses and cleans `wards-outdated.csv` |
| WardServiceApp | [`ward-service/`](ward-service) | 7031 | Provides lists of wards and departments. |
| AlertLevelServiceApp | [`alert-level-service/`](alert-level-service) | 7032 | Tracks the hospital Emergency Status (0-8, 8 = full Code Blue). |
| StaffingServiceApp | [`staffing-service/`](staffing-service) | 7033 | Provides on-call schedules for doctors based on ward and status. |
| EquipmentAlertServiceApp | [`equipment-alert-service/`](equipment-alert-service) | 7034 | uses a Queue to guarantee delivery of critical medical equipment failure alerts. |

Plus [`common/`](common) (no port) — the shared ActiveMQ broker and MQ config notes
for `staffing-events-topic`: Staffing updates are broadcast as Events via the broker to decouple the frontend from the Staffing Service.

**Status:** Implemented — the core REST integration, ActiveMQ staffing topic, and
equipment failure queue are complete and verified end-to-end.

## Implementation

HealthSafe was implemented incrementally through the following integration stages:

1. **Ingestion** (required) — in `IngestionServiceApp`, read and clean
   `wards-outdated.csv` (see [ingestion-service/README.md](ingestion-service/README.md)
   for the known data issues and a worked example) and expose the cleaned records
   over REST for `ward-service` to consume.
2. **REST services** (required) — implement `ward-service`, `alert-level-service`,
   and `staffing-service` per the [Integration contracts](#integration-contracts)
   below: wards/departments lookup, Emergency Status tracking, and on-call
   scheduling that calls the other two services synchronously over HTTP.
3. **MQ decoupling** (stretch) — replace the synchronous call from `ward-service`
   to `staffing-service` with the `staffing-events-topic` broadcast described in
   [common/README.md](common/README.md), so staffing updates reach `ward-service`
   asynchronously instead.
4. **Alerting** (stretch) — have `ward-service` publish to the
   `equipment-failure-queue` when it detects an equipment failure, and implement
   `equipment-alert-service` as the guaranteed-delivery consumer (see
   [equipment-alert-service/README.md](equipment-alert-service/README.md)).

Automated tests aren't required, but are a good way to show your work — see each
service's `## Test` section for how to add JUnit 5.

## Integration contracts

Endpoint shapes below are illustrative, not a fixed spec to match byte-for-byte —
reasonable field names/status codes are fine as long as the calling service can
consume them.

| From | To | Call | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ward-service` | `ingestion-service` | `GET /wards` → cleaned ward records | Populate its own ward/department list |
| `staffing-service` | `ward-service` | `GET /wards/{id}` → `404` if unknown | Validate the ward before scheduling |
| `staffing-service` | `alert-level-service` | `GET /alert-level` → `{ "level": 0-8 }` | Read current Emergency Status to size the on-call schedule |
| `staffing-service` | `ward-service` (topic, stage 3) | publish to `staffing-events-topic` | Broadcast a schedule/status change |
| `ward-service` (topic, stage 3) | — | subscribe to `staffing-events-topic` | React to staffing updates without polling |
| `ward-service` (queue, stage 4) | `equipment-alert-service` | publish to `equipment-failure-queue` | Guarantee delivery of an equipment failure alert |

## Build

Requirements: Java 17+, Maven 3.8+, Docker (for the broker in `common/`).

Every folder here (`ingestion-service/`, each domain service, and `equipment-alert-service/`) is
an **independent** Maven project — there is no parent/aggregator pom. Build one at a
time, e.g.:

```
cd ward-service
mvn package
```

...or build every module in the repo in one pass from the project root:

```
find . -name pom.xml -execdir mvn -q package \;
```

## Run

```
# ingestion
cd ingestion-service && mvn package && java -jar target/ingestion-service.jar

# domain services, each in its own terminal
# terminal 1
cd ward-service && mvn package && java -jar target/ward-service.jar
# terminal 2
cd alert-level-service && mvn package && java -jar target/alert-level-service.jar
# terminal 3
cd staffing-service && mvn package && java -jar target/staffing-service.jar

# MQ broker (needed once the MQ-aware services above are wired up)
cd common && docker compose up -d

# alerting
cd equipment-alert-service && mvn package && java -jar target/equipment-alert-service.jar
```

| Service | Port |
|---|---|
| IngestionServiceApp (`ingestion-service`) | 7030 |
| WardServiceApp (`ward-service`) | 7031 |
| AlertLevelServiceApp (`alert-level-service`) | 7032 |
| StaffingServiceApp (`staffing-service`) | 7033 |
| EquipmentAlertServiceApp (`equipment-alert-service`) | 7034 |

## Test

Automated tests are included for the ingestion service. The complete system can also
be verified through the `/health` endpoints and the REST/MQ integration flows.

```
curl http://localhost:7030/health   # -> OK
```

To add real tests to a module, add JUnit 5 and Surefire to its `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
  <version>5.10.2</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.2.5</version>
</plugin>
```

then add tests under that module's `src/test/java/...` and run:

```
mvn test
```
